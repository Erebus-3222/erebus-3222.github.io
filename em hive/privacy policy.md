This Privacy Policy outlines how EM Hive handles data when operating within your Discord server.

## Summary

EM Hive is an automated moderation and anti-cheat bot for RedM communities. It stores minimal data to function and does not collect unnecessary information.

## Data Collected

- **Discord User IDs**: Used to identify flagged or reported users.
- **Guild IDs**: Used to track which servers the bot is active in.
- **Flag Reasons & Report Content**: Stored only when a user is reported.
- **Timestamps**: Used for audit logs and moderation timelines.

## How Data is Used

- To detect and respond to flagged accounts.
- To allow server administrators to submit reports against suspicious users.
- To synchronize bans across participating EM Hive servers.
- To display aggregate server participation data (e.g., member counts, server names).

## Data Retention

- Reports and flag logs are retained as long as the bot is active or until requested for deletion.
- Data is stored securely and is not shared outside EM Studios moderation staff.

## What We Don’t Do

- ❌ We do not read, log, or store your server’s chat messages.
- ❌ We do not sell or share data with advertisers or third parties.
- ❌ We do not track users across different bots or platforms.

## User Rights

- Users can request a copy of any data the bot has recorded about them.
- Users can request deletion of any report or flag associated with their ID by opening a support ticket in the EM Studios Discord.

## Opt-Out & Removal

- Removing the bot from your server halts all data tracking.
- To request data deletion for your server or individual account, please contact us through the [EM Studios Discord](https://discord.gg/pugmjxBKR8).

## Changes

This privacy policy may be updated at any time. We will notify admins of major changes via our status embed or support server.
