These Terms of Use govern your use of the EM Hive Discord Bot.

## Purpose

EM Hive is a moderation and anti-cheat tool designed for RedM communities. It automates detection, reporting, and cross-server moderation features for participating servers.

## Data Handling

- The bot stores **user IDs**, **guild IDs**, and report/flag data strictly for moderation purposes.
- No message content is recorded or stored.
- EM Studios does **not sell, share, or distribute** this data to third parties.

## Your Responsibilities

- Server administrators must notify users that an anti-cheat bot is active.
- You may not copy, redistribute, modify, or reverse-engineer the bot.
- The reporting features may not be used to harass, falsely accuse, or spam others.

## Limitations

- EM Hive is a **support tool** and does not replace server staff or judgment.
- EM Studios makes no guarantees about accuracy or uptime.
- The bot may experience service interruptions or false positives.

## Removal and Blocking

We reserve the right to:
- Remove the bot from servers found to be abusing its tools.
- Block users or servers from future use.
- Modify or remove bot features at any time.

## Appeals

Users who are flagged by EM Hive may appeal via the EM Studios Discord:

## Changes

Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the bot implies agreement to the latest version.
